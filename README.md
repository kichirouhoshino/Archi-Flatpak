# Archi-Flatpak

This is a Flatpak definition of Archi. This uses the release binaries from the official site.

While the app can be built from source, it is currently a pain to do as flatpak-builder does not have proper maven support yet. If support does finally arrive, someone else would've probably made a proper (or official) flatpak for it.

I made this mostly for personal use.
